# Randomness {#sec:randomness}

Randomness is an idea, like straightness, that may be hard to observe in perfect form. Consider straightness first. A straight line made using a ruler and a pencil is easily distinguished from a wiggly line or a very curvy one. However, if we examine the pencil markings under a magnifying glass, we can observe tiny wiggles at the edge. These wiggles may be due to the texture of the paper or the imperfections in the graphite (the pencil's "lead") or both. Nevertheless, we are able to hold in our minds a mathematical idea of a straight line. For example, we can define a line algebraically in the $(x,y)$ Euclidean plane by the equation 

$$ y = 2 x + 3.$$

This formula, which expresses a linear relationship, assumes a fair amount of prior knowledge, which most of us learn in school. For example, that $x$ and $y$ can take on real-number values, that the $y$ axis is perpendicular to the x-axis, etc. The line expressed in the formula is perfectly straight. Even if we draw it using only an approximately straight line.

YouTuber [Vsauce's video on "What is Random?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rIy0xY99a0) explores whether things that we take for granted as being random (e.g., coin flips) really are.  If you watch this video, you may come away convinced the outcome of tossing a coin or rolling a die is not truly random, and that quantum mechanics is the only truly random mechanism in nature. Alternately you may be satisfied that the fact of having limited information is sufficient to justify the treatment of a coin toss as a random event. On this argument, as long as you can't tell the difference between a coin and a truly random coin, you can, for all intents and purposes, treat is as perfectly random.


As with straightness, we can define an ideal random process. For example, we can define an ideal fair coin toss using mathematical notation, although this notation is less commonly learned in school. Here's one way:

$$ x \in \{H, T\} \qquad P(x=H) = p$$

Now $x$ is not a real number but rather the outcome of a coin toss. The first part of the formula specifies that $x$ can take on two possible values, heads (H) or tails (T). This is abbreviated here in set notation. We can read it as "$x$ is an element of the set containing H and T." The second part defines the probability that $x$ is observed to have a value of H. The probability is $p$, which is a *parameter* that stands in for some number between 0 and 1. For a fair coin $p=0.5$. Although it is not written out explicitly, the probability of a coin coming up tails must be $1-p$ due to the axioms of probability and fact that there are only two possible outcomes.

For a fair six-sided die, we can write

$$ x \in \{1, 2, \dots, 6\} \qquad P(x=n) = 1/6 \quad \forall n \in \{1, 2, \dots, 6\}. $$

The "forall" symbol (an upside down A) is a shorthand we use to indicate that all outcomes are equally probable, with probability of 1/6. We can read this part as, "the probability that $x$ is observed to take the value $n$ is equal to 1/6 for all $n$ in the set containing the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6."
