# Purpose

On April 10, 2020, [ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/nyc-stark-contrast-covid-19-infection-rates-based/story?id=69920706) covered an online report (by the NYU Furman Center) that examined cases of COVID-19 in New York City on a neighborhood level. Most COVID-19 data that had been coming out had been reporting on the city as a whole. The main idea here was that neighborhoods tell a different story than data at the city level. Data scientist call this a shift in the unit-of-analysis. For example, some neighborhoods are wealthier and some poorer. Neighborhoods also vary by racial composition. If we examine COVID-19 outcomes by neighborhood, we may be able to see patterns and associations between disease incidence and race or socio-economic variables. Indeed, the Furman Center found such associations. The ABC News report produced images like the following:

![zipcode map showing concentration of COVID-19 cases in  NYC](images/abc_COVID19NycZip_v03_KA_hpEmbed_17x12_992.jpg) 


People familiar with the layout of New York City might be able to identify low-income and largely African-American neighborhoods like Hunts Point in the South Bronx.  ABC News produced a corresponding map showing the share of adults with college degree.

![zipcode map showing share of adults with college degree in NYC](images/abc_CollegeDegreeNycZip_v02_KA_hpEmbed_17x12_992.jpg)

It requires switching back and forth between these images, but the dark regions on the COVID map (higher rates of disease) seem to correspond to the lighter regions on the college degree map (lower college share). 
 
How does one make these data visualizations? And are they the best way to "see" the signals in the data?

ABC News also reproduced their own version of this table, showing racial composition. Althought the title may confuse matters, in this table, multiple neighborhoods (zipcodes) are actually being grouped together into five sets using **quintiles.** You take all of the zipcodes, rank-order them by COVID-19 concentration, and then select the bottom fifth, the next fifth, and so on up to the top fifth. Technically, the quintiles are the cut-points, so for five groups, there are four quintiles. This is very confusing. Of course, this division process can be done for a different number of **quantiles**--note the spelling--not necessarily five. A division of three groups is made by choose (two cut-point) tertiles or terciles. The median is the 2-quantile, as it is the cut-point that divides a data set into two equal parts.

![table of data showing](images/abc_COVID19RacialComp_v02_KA_hpEmbed_37x16_992.jpg)

If you look at the table above, you may notice trends or patterns between racial composition (of these groups of neighborhoods) and COVID-19 concentration. The trends are not perfectly linear. But, for example, the proportion of Black and Hispanic people in the low-concentration neighborhoods is37.3%. While in the high concentration neighborhoods, this combined share is 55.6%.

In the remainder of this tutorial, we will examine how to recreate graphs and tables like the one above from publicly available data. This will enable you to create your own versions or update the ones above with new data. We will also look at alternative representations and at some simulation-based tests to see how likely it is that such disparities might occur by chance.

Let's begin!

# Getting Data

```{r}
library(censusapi)
library(dplyr)
myKey = Sys.getenv("CENSUS_KEY") #store your key in .Renvriron
```


To get census data, you can go to (https://data.census.gov/), but be warned: it is a big maze and not that easy to navigate. What the pros who make media reports do (probably) is use the US Census API to make specific requests for data. To do this yourself you will need an API key. This is easy enough to get, but you need to [request one here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). Once you have a key, you can declare it in your R code or, better for security/code-sharing, embed it in a .Renviron file.

More importantly, you need to know what you're asking for. That means you need to know which data sets, which variables, which geographic units, etc. A 20-page [API users guide can be found here](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/data/developers/api-user-guide/api-guide.pdf). In this tutorial, I will walk you through the steps of creating some of the figures and tables that go into media reports about COVID-19 outcomes. The examples here are all NYC-centric, but the methods, especially for US Census data, are completely general. 


## Local data on COVID from the city and/or state

For state and municipality-level COVID-19 data in New York, these are some sources:

+ https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-data-archive.page
+ https://github.com/nychealth/coronavirus-data
+ https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e

These sources are updated daily. I will be working with the GitHub data as of April 23. For example, here I will load and view the borough-level data table. 

```{r}
nyc_boro_data <- read.csv("data/coronavirus-nyc/boro.csv")
nyc_boro_data
```

According to the documentation in the GitHub README file, this contains rates of confirmed cases, by NYC borough of residence. Rates are:

+ Cumulative since the start of the outbreak
+ Age adjusted according to [the US 2000 standard population](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/statnt/statnt20.pdf)
+ Per 100,000 people in the borough

What does age-adjusted rate mean? You can read the link, but the main idea here is to try to put all of the boroughs on equal footing in the rate per 100,000 people, even if some boroughs have an older or younger population than others. 

**Exercise**: Compute the population adjusted rate per 100,000 people using population data from the census. How does it differ from the age-adjusted rate? 

If we wanted to do age-adjustment, or even simpler, population adjustment, we would need to supplement this COVID data with population data, for example obtained from the US Census. Before we turn to that, let us just quickly explore the other data provided by NYC.

```{r}
nyc_age_data <- read.csv("data/coronavirus-nyc/by-age.csv")
nyc_sex_data <- read.csv("data/coronavirus-nyc/by-sex.csv")

nyc_sex_data
```

Case and fatality rates by sex show that males are being infected and dying at significantly higher rates. Note that each of these is already adjusted to rate per 100,000.

```{r}
nyc_age_data
```

Age-level data show a few interesting features. For one, children are barely even getting infected. Among adults, infection rates are slightly higher for older adults, but death rates are much higher. We could derive a measure of case fatality rate (CFR) as follows:

```{r}
nyc_age_data$CFR <- round(nyc_age_data$DEATH_RATE/nyc_age_data$COVID_CASE_RATE, 3)
nyc_age_data
```

From this we see that adults 75 and older have a `r paste0(nyc_age_data$CFR[5]*100,"%")` chance of dying from COVID-19, compared to a `r paste0(nyc_age_data$CFR[3]*100,"%")` for adults between 45-64.


**Exercise**: compute the case fatality rate by sex.

The most captivating data set provided by the city (hence the images we started out with) is probably the zipcode-level data, the first few rows of which look like this:


```{r}
nyc_zipcode_data <- read.csv("data/coronavirus-nyc/tests-by-zcta.csv")
head(nyc_zipcode_data,20)
```

Notice that the first row is missing a zipcode. Presumably these are COVID tests for which we do not know where the people who were tested actually reside. For each other row, we have a zipcode, the number of positive tests, the number of total tests, and the percent positive.

**Exercise**: Which of these expressions should give the percent positive tests

+ `nyc_zipcode_data$Total/nyc_zipcode_data$Positive*100`
+ `nyc_zipcode_data$Positive/nyc_zipcode_data$Total`
+ `nyc_zipcode_data$Positive/nyc_zipcode_data$Total*100`
+ `(nyc_zipcode_data$Total-nyc_zipcode_data$Positive)`
+ `(nyc_zipcode_data$Total-nyc_zipcode_data$Positive)*100`


```{r}
```

## Census data
<!-- (permutation tests the zipcode data) -->

We will be interested in the [American Community Survey 5-Year data](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html) which provide estimates aggregated over a 5-year period every two years. The last published data set, i.e., the most current one available, is from 2018.

#### Census Variables

There are something like 20,000 variables available, and these can be requested invidividually or in groups. Some useful groups for our analysis are the following

+ B01001	SEX BY AGE	
  + Keep in mind this has a lot of subcategories, such as Male 5-9 Years, Male 10-14 years, etc.
+ B02001	RACE	
+ B19013	MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS

For each group, a list of variables can be found on a corresponding website. For example, to find the variables in the SEX BY AGE group, you can go to https://api.census.gov/data/2018/acs/acs5/groups/B01001.html (notice the URL ending is the same as the group). There you will find variables such as

+ B01001_002E	Estimate!!Total!!Male
+ B01001_026E	Estimate!!Total!!Female

It turn out you can also query the API to get this information, as we shall see below. In any case, variables that end in E are estimates. For each one there is often a margin of error, which is the same code ending in M instead of E. Finally for both estimates and margins of error, there may be annotations (e.g. B01001_002EA and B01001_002MA), if these numbers are not straightforward. Details about annotation meanings can be found  [here](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-1year/notes-on-acs-estimate-and-annotation-values.html).


+ B01003_001E

#### Geography Units

Census data are available at many levels related to geography. The smallest unit is the census "block"  which typically contains between 600 and 3000 people. A collection of blocks forms a tract. But US states are also divided into counties, and both state and county can be used as identifiers. However, one has to use numberical identifiers. For example, the borough of Brooklyn is actually Kings County, NY, which is county 047 in state 36. And yes, you have to include all three digits, including the leading zero, to identify individual counties. Zip-code tabulation areas is one more option, wherein you specify the five-digit zip code. We will want to use that, because NYC provided COVID-19 testing data at the zip-code level. 

First, let's retrieve some data about the five boroughs. To request the median household income we will request the variable "B19013_001E" (intuitive, right!)


```{r echo=TRUE}
income_boro <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                         vintage = 2018,
                         vars = c("NAME", "B19013_001E"),
                         region = "county:005,047,061,081,085",
                         regionin = "state:36", 
                         key = myKey)

income_boro
```
There it is, five-year averages, inflation-adjusted for 2018 dollars, by borough. (If you see one-year estimates, they may  be a bit higher than these numbers, if wages went up faster than inflation).

```{r}
boroNames <- c("Queens","Brooklyn","Manhattan","StatenI", "Bronx")
boro_income <- data.frame(Borough = boroNames, medianIncome = income_boro$B19013_001E)
boro_income
```

Data from the SEX BY AGE group will be more complicated-looking because this group contains many more variables. In fact, the following API call will have 201 columns, all with names like B01001_047E!

```{r}
sexByAge_boro <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                           vintage = 2018,
                           vars = c("NAME", "group(B01001)"),
                           region = "county:005,047,061,081,085",
                           regionin = "state:36", 
                           key = myKey)

dim(sexByAge_boro)
```

We'll want to filter this down and rename the variables.

```{r}
# a list of groups can be found here
# acs_groups <- listCensusMetadata(name = "acs/acs5", vintage = 2018, type = "groups")
# head(acs_groups)

# here are the variables in the SEX BY AGE group
group_B01001 <- listCensusMetadata(name = "acs/acs5",
                                   vintage = 2018,
                                   type = "variables",
                                   group = "B01001")
head(group_B01001[order(group_B01001$name),], 20)

```

Note that our list of variables also includes variable type. Here we have "int" for integers (numbers) and "string" which is the computational shorthand for "string of characters." This is the variable type used for words and sentences as well as passwords or other random strings of characters. 

To make the results more readable, we can try identify the pattern in the order of the variables. First, let's observe the following:

```{r}
myVars <- paste0("B01001_0",sprintf("%02d", 20:50), "E")
group_B01001 %>% filter(name %in% myVars) %>% arrange(name)

```


We've learned the following. The variable names (after the total) begin with males. First all males, then males by increasing age group. The females. Although it looks like it from this sample, the age groups are not all in intervals of 5 years. There are groups of three, two, and even one (e.g., 15-17, 18-19, 20 years). I'm not sure why.

Suppose we wanted to extract the percentage of the population over the age of 65. From this table we would need to do the following

+ add up the counts of males in each of the intervals over 65
 + B01001_020E + B01001_021E + B01001_022E + B01001_023E + B01001_024E + B01001_025E
+ add to this the counts of females in the same age intervals
  + B01001_044E + B01001_045E + B01001_046E + B01001_047E + B01001_048E + B01001_049E
+ divide by the total
  + B01001_001E


```{r}

maleOver65Vars <- c("B01001_020E","B01001_021E","B01001_022E","B01001_023E","B01001_024E","B01001_025E")
femaleOver65Vars <- c("B01001_044E","B01001_045E","B01001_046E","B01001_047E","B01001_048E","B01001_049E")
totalPopVar <- "B01001_001E"
boro_over65 <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                           vintage = 2018,
                           vars = c("NAME", maleOver65Vars,femaleOver65Vars, totalPopVar),
                           region = "county:005,047,061,081,085",
                           regionin = "state:36", 
                           key = myKey)

proportionsA <- rowSums(boro_over65[,4:15])/boro_over65[,16] 
boro_over65_proportions <- cbind()

```


Maybe we should just look at median age????

```{r}
medianSexByAge_boro <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                                 vintage = 2018,
                                 vars = c("NAME", "group(B01002)"),
                                 region = "county:005,047,061,081,085",
                                 regionin = "state:36", 
                                 key = myKey)

medianSexByAge_boro
```

We can probably just focus on these three variables

+ B01001_002E	Estimate!!Total!!Male
+ B01001_026E	Estimate!!Total!!Female
+ B01002_001E	Estimate!!Median age --!!Total
+ B01002_002E	Estimate!!Median age --!!Male
+ B01002_003E	Estimate!!Median age --!!Female

This may do for age and sex variables. 

To match the NYC race-level data we will need these categories of Race/Ethnicity

+ All Hispanic
+ Non-Hispanic/Latino: Black,African American
+ Non-Hispanic/Latino: White
+ Non-Hispanic/Latino: Asian
+ Non-Hispanic/Latino: Other

The 2018 population estimates reported for these categories should be as follows, so we can check if we are getting the right totals before we look at zip-codes

Population
(2018 estimate)

2,449,450
1,849,077
2,694,258
1,231,790
174,173

First we need to find the necessary race variables. The Census organizes this information in different variable groups, some of which separate out Hispanic or Latino origin (B03002) and some which do not (B02001). We will use the first one, again to match the way NYC has been reporting health data.

```{r}
group_B03002 <- listCensusMetadata(name = "acs/acs5",
                                   vintage = 2018,
                                   type = "variables",
                                   group = "B03002")
head(group_B03002[order(group_B03002$name),], 20)
```

Okay we're on the right track but it would be nice to see this list without the margin of errors and annotation variables. How can we get a list of variables that end in E but not in M or EA or MA? The answer is something called regular expressions, which is a specialist term for pattern matching. This is a long topic, so we are just going to work out one type of example, which is matching strings with a specific ending.  The R function for "get regular expression" is called `grep()`.

```{r}
# suppose we have a list of words and we want to know which ones end in the letter "e"
# The end of a string is denoted by $ in regular expressions, so to match "e at the end"
# we look for a pattern that we write as "e$"
# 
someFruit <- c("apple", "orange", "banana", "pear")
grep("e$", someFruit)
```


By default `grep` returns the indices of the matched values, not the values themselves. In this case, the first two words matched. If we want the values, we use grep as follows

```{r}
grep("e$", someFruit, value = TRUE)
```

You can probably guess how to modify this pattern to find the string ending in "a" instead. If you want both, that is strings ending in either "a" or "e", this is the way to do it.


```{r}
grep("(e|a)$", someFruit, value = TRUE)
```

With this, let's reduce the list of variables

```{r}
View(group_B03002[grep("E$", group_B03002$name),])

```

With this easier to parse table, we can select the variables we want in particular

+ B03002_001E Estimate!!Total	
+ B03002_002E	Estimate!!Total!!Not Hispanic or Latino
+	B03002_003E	Estimate!!Total!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!White alone
+ B03002_004E	Estimate!!Total!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!Black or African American alone
+ B03002_006E	Estimate!!Total!!Not Hispanic or Latino!!Asian alone
+ B03002_012E	Estimate!!Total!!Hispanic or Latino

We'll use the first two for normalizing proportions and for determining the non-Hispanic "Other" category. To get race by borough,

```{r}
race_boro <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                       vintage = 2018,
                       vars = c("NAME", "B03002_012E", "B03002_004E", "B03002_003E", "B03002_006E",
                                "B03002_002E", "B03002_001E"),
                       region = "county:005,047,061,081,085",
                       regionin = "state:36", 
                       key = myKey)

# give variable names
names(race_boro)[4:9] = c("Hisp", "NH_Black", "NH_White", "NH_Asian", "NH_Total", "Total")

# create the non-Hispanic Other category
race_boro <- race_boro %>% mutate(NH_Other = NH_Total-NH_Black-NH_White-NH_Asian) 

# convert to proportions by dividing by total
race_boro_proportion <- race_boro  %>% transmute(Hisp = Hisp/Total, NH_Black = NH_Black/Total, 
            NH_White=NH_White/Total, NH_Asian=NH_Asian/Total, NH_Other=NH_Other/Total) %>%
            round(., digits=3) * 100

race_boro_proportion$Borough <- c("Queens","Brooklyn","Manhattan","StatenI", "Bronx")
race_boro_proportion 
``` 


#### Zip-code tabulation area

We're going to want to use zip-code tract areas, and we will get our list from the nyc data

``` {r}
nyc_zcta_covid <- read.csv("data/coronavirus-nyc/tests-by-zcta.csv")
nyc_zipcodes <- nyc_zcta_covid %>% select(MODZCTA) %>% na.omit() %>% unlist()
# for the API call, we will want all zipcodes in plain text with comma separation
nyc_zipcode_string <- paste(nyc_zipcodes, collapse=",")

```

### Zip-code-level median income


```{r}
zcta_income <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                         vintage = 2018,
                         vars = c("B19013_001E"),
                         region = paste0("zip code tabulation area:",nyc_zipcode_string),
                         key=myKey)
```

```{r}
names(zcta_income) <- c("zipcode","median_income")
View(zcta_income)
```

### Zip-code-level race

```{r}
zcta_race <- getCensus(name = "acs/acs5",
                       vintage = 2018,
                       vars = c("B03002_012E", "B03002_004E", "B03002_003E", "B03002_006E",
                                "B03002_002E", "B03002_001E"),
                       region = paste0("zip code tabulation area:",nyc_zipcode_string),
                       key = myKey)

# give variable names
names(zcta_race) = c("zipcode", "Hisp", "NH_Black", "NH_White", "NH_Asian", "NH_Total", "Total")

# create the non-Hispanic Other category
zcta_race <- zcta_race %>% mutate(NH_Other = NH_Total-NH_Black-NH_White-NH_Asian) 

# convert to proportions by dividing by total
zcta_race_proportion <- zcta_race  %>% transmute(Hisp = Hisp/Total, NH_Black = NH_Black/Total, 
            NH_White=NH_White/Total, NH_Asian=NH_Asian/Total, NH_Other=NH_Other/Total) %>%
            round(., digits=3) * 100

zcta_race_proportion <- cbind(zipcode=zcta_race$zipcode, zcta_race_proportion) 
zcta_race_proportion
``` 




```{r}
searchResults <- makeVarlist(name = "acs/acs5",
                             find = "Asian",
                             varsearch = "label")
searchResults
```
