## Latent Factors and Measurement {-}

Figure \@ref(fig:apps-windows) ([source](https://2kindsofpeople.tumblr.com/)) shows two more two-kinds of people graphics from JoÃ£o Rocha's blog. I bet that you can identify yourself with one of the two images in each pair. I certainly can. But ask yourself, given our discussion above, do you think the choices a person would identify in each case above are independent or not independent (e.g., contingent, associated, dependent)?

In contrast to the toilet paper and peanut butter questions, which at least appear to be about totally different things, these two dichotomies have something similar going on in each of them. The choice on the left is about organizing your desktop browser, either in tabs or as separate windows. The choice on the right is about organizing apps in your smartphone, either loose or in folders. We might say that both of them get at a tendency to organize your digital environment. Call it digitidness (short for digital tidiness). This tendency, we may imagine, might even carry over into non-digital environments, like your actual desk, bookshelf, or filing cabinet.

What we've done here is to try to explain the association between responses to the two questions (assuming that there is, i.e. that they are not independent) by appeal to some underlying **latent factor**. We say a factor is latent (meaning hidden) because we don't observe digitidiness itself directly, but we only observe tidy browsers or smartphone app folders. Perhaps you can think of another candidate factor besides digitidiness. In any case, we might propose that each of the two two-kinds questions in Figure \@ref(fig:apps-windows) are in fact indirect **measurements** of the same factor. If so, this could explain why the two answers woudl be associated.

> Notice that a **factor** is also a dimension, in the sense we used before. We could have said "latent dimension", but we tend to use the word factor when we are drawing attention to the specific nature of the dimension rather than just counting. We also sometimes use the word **trait**. At least in psychology, trait tends to be reserved for stable psychological factors. Thus "stress" can be a factor but not a trait, whereas "social anxiety" may be a trait, if it is persistent. In this case, digitidiness might be considered a trait (and thus also a factor and a dimension). 

Contrast this with toilet roll orientation, which we can observe directly just by looking in someone's bathroom. (We assume that they are telling the truth when they answered our questions, but we could in principle verify it.) It was only in the bizarro world when toilet roll orientation and peanut butter preference were perfectly related that we started to wonder if there maybe *was* an underlying genetic factor. Genetic factors were once not directly observable either, but we assumed them for explanatory value. Today we can of course observe specific genetic variation, although there are still many gaps in our understanding of the relationship between genes and observed behaviors.

Consider some data again, in two possible worlds, shown in Table \@ref(tab:tabsxapps). On the left, we have the deterministic scenario we saw before. As before, we identified this situation as having two kinds of people and really just one dimension. In contrast to before, where we had no real explanation for this coincidence, we attribute it now to some factor, like digital tidiness.



```{r, 'tabsxapps', echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

tabsxapps <- matrix(c(21,0,0,19), nrow=2)
tabsxapps2 <- matrix(c(16,5,6,13), nrow=2)
rownames(tabsxapps2) <- rownames(tabsxapps) <- c("browser-tabs","browser-windows")
colnames(tabsxapps2) <- colnames(tabsxapps) <- c("app-folders","apps-loose")

kable(list(tabsxapps, tabsxapps2), 
      caption="Possible data for digital tidiness", 
      booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "bordered", full_width = F) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))

```

But now consider the possible results in the table on the right. Since all four possible quadrants have non-zero counts, we see that knowing whether someone organizes their browser using tabs does not completely (i.e., *deterministically*) specify whether or not they put their apps into folders. On the other hand, one answer *does seem to be associated* with the other. Notice that the values are still much higher in the diagonal "buckets" that we think of as indicating the presence or absence of digitial tidiness. These are the tabs-folders bucket (tidy) or the windows-loose bucket (not tidy). We say that the tidiness factor appears to explain much of the observed range, or **variance**, in responses to the two questions. But it doesn't explain all of it, since there are people (11 out of 40, in this case) who don't fall into one of these buckets. 

This situation on the right is probably more realistic. After all, very few things in this world are absolute (unlike in bizarro world). So now the big question re-emerges: are there two kinds of people or four? One dimension, or two? It's sort of...like...in between...?

<div class="col2">
**Golda says**: Although digitidiness explains a lot of what we see in our data, it doesn't explain it all. I believe that desktop tidiness and mobile tidiness are different, if related, tendencies. For example, when we use mobile phones, we're typically on-the-go and have less time. If we knew more about the people in our sample, we might see that these discrepancies in the organization of apps and tabs actually relate to other aspects of their lives. So, I say there are two dimensions.

**Sidney says**: Digitidiness is the only real factor here, but people may not always be consistent in these particular behaviors. Also some people are only sort-of-tidy, and apply this tidiness unevenly and randomly. These two-kinds of people choices don't leave room for shades of gray, so that's what we're seeing in the mixed categories where people are tidy in one environment and not in another. But ultimately there is really just one dimension here.
