# How Many Kinds of People Are There?

```
There are 10 kinds of people in this world. 
Those who understand binary code and those who don't.

## Things are about to get meta right from the start

I'm going to start off this book about data science and statistics with an unsubstantiated claim. My claim is this: People love to categorize themselves and others. They love to take quizzes online that tell you "what kind of person you are" in some way or another. They love to make statements that begin with, "there are two kinds of people in this world..." and so on. Ok? That's my claim. It's a bit of a mouthful.


Now, I just made a claim in support of which data *can absolutely* be brought to bear. But I won't use data to support it. What? Why not, for cyring out loud?! This is a book about data science!!! The reason is this: this book encourages you to think critically and skeptically about all kinds of ideas, claims, and questions. It tries to show you how to talk about these ideas precisely and not succumb to fallacies and bad intuition. But while trying to develop these skills, it is important to know when we are in turbo critical thinking mode (that's a technical term^[It's not really a technical term.]) and when we're not. Sometimes, we need to be able to say common-sense things and not have to support them.

What *exactly* am I even saying in my claim, you might be thinking? What do you mean by, "people love to" do X, where X, like ______ ["blank"], is a stand-in for some of the specific things I mentioned. That everybody does X? Most people? That people who do X derive pleasure above some pleasure threshold, thus designating "love" as opposed to "like?" You see, I could have tried to make my claim more precise. And I could have found polls and published reports that estimate just how many people have, by choice, taken some kind of person-category-test-thing, or posted funny jokes about "two kinds of people." But I'm just letting my claim stand as a common-sense claim. Just like if I said, people love going to the movies with friends. I wouldn't feel the need to cite a scientific study to support that claim.

Now, if someone is making what to *them* appears to be a common-sense claim but to you appears false or at least non-obvious, you have a few options. You can challenge the assumption and ask for evidence. Or you can accept the assumption, *for argument's sake*, to see where this is going. Hopefully, my claim feels common-sense to you too (we have that in common). If not, I'll just ask you to follow along to see where this is all going...

Particulary when represented graphically or pictorially, "two kinds of people" questions have become something of an internet meme. There is a whole [blog devoted to them by Jo√£o Rocha](https://2kindsofpeople.tumblr.com/). The images in Figure \@ref(fig:tp-fig) probably need no explanation, as they concerns the great [toilet paper orientation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet_paper_orientation) debate.

Toilet paper orientation is a distinguishing "test question" that separates people into one of two kinds. You choose one way or the other. Let's call this roll choice over_hang (shown on left) or under_hang (shown on right). Perhaps you have debated which is better with a friend or family member. Or perhaps you are lucky enough to have never thought about it at all. In any case, armed with this particular test question, we can go out an collect some data. 

```{r echo=FALSE}
set.seed(20190507)
binomial_draw <- rbinom(50,1, prob=0.58)
theWayIRoll <- ifelse(binomial_draw==1, "over_hang", "under_hang")
TPcounts <- as.data.frame(table(binomial_draw), row.names=c("under_hang", "over_hang"))
```

```{r tp-table, echo=FALSE}
### NOT LATEX COMPATIBLE
kable(table(theWayIRoll), col.names = c("", "counts"), caption="How my friends roll", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T)

# TPcounts %>% select(counts=Freq) %>%
#   kable(., caption="How I Roll", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
#   kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = F, position = "float_right")

```

I went ahead and asked 50 of my closest friends which kind of person they were, and the results are shown in Table \@ref(tab:tp-table). This being a book about data science, you might think we're going to start calculating proportions right away, for example that `r 100*round(prop.table(table(theWayIRoll))["over_hang"],2)`% of my closest friends are over-hangers. 
Nope. Although you should be able to figure out that proportion conversion, it is not the point we want to focus on right now. That point is that, based on our data, there *are* indeed two kinds of people among my friends. If, for example, everyone in the world were an under-hanger (heaven forbid), then we couldn't very well say that there were two kinds of people in this world. It would be like if I presented you with the data in Table \@ref(tab:dumb-table). I can't very well convince you that there are two kinds of people based on these data.


```{r dumb-table, echo=FALSE}
### NOT LATEX COMPATIBLE
iamaperson <- data.frame(count = c(50,0), row.names = c("person","not a person"))
kable(iamaperson, caption="My closest friends are one kind", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T)

```

That all seems pretty obvious, in part because I made up a *tautology* in the second example there. Being a person is automatically associated with everyone who can be a *kind of person*. But what if I had gotten exactly the same results for the toilet paper question? What if the data looked like Table \@ref(tab:tp-redux) and everyone was an over_hanger? Does that mean that there is only one kind of person when it comes to toilet paper orientation? Not necessarily. While it may hold among my friends, that they are all of a kind in this respect, this **sample** is not the entire **population**. 

It was important to put a pin in that idea, which we'll come back to later. For example, we will definitely want to know how confident we can be about a larger population of people from a sample.


```{r tp-redux, echo=FALSE}
### NOT LATEX COMPATIBLE
iamaperson <- data.frame(count = c(50,0), row.names = c("over_hang","under_hang"))
kable(iamaperson, caption="How my friends roll", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = T)

```
