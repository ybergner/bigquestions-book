# Sixteen Personalities or Five Factors?

Before you read this chapter, you might want to go ahead and take one of the personality tests based on 
the Meyers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) categories and/or the five-factor model of personality (also called the Big Five). There is only one "official" MBTI, which is a commercial product. However, there are several free alternatives online which use the same typology classification. There are also several variations of

I will only minimially describe the MBTI and the Five Factor Model (FFM, or Big Five) here, in terms of the topics we have been discussing. There are many resources for learning more about these personality tests. Some are referenced under further reading.

### MBTI {-}

The MBTI will categorize people, based on their responses, dichotomously along each of four dimensions, also called "scales." These are:

- Extraversion-Introversion (E-I)
- Sensation-Intuition (S-N)
- Thinking-Feeling (T-F)
- Judging-Perceiving (J-P)

Thus there are sixteen possible combinations, for example "INTP". Each person is assigned to one of these sixteen personalities. Many online tests will provide you with a report to help interpret your classification. That is, the four dimensions are understood to come together in some holistic picture of your "type."

### Big Five {-}  

The term "Big Five" is a commonly used term for the five-factor model of personality. Based on responses to questionnaires, people are assigned a numerical score along five dimensions (also called scales or factors!)

- Neuroticism refers to the tendency to experience negative feelings.
- Extraversion is marked by pronounced engagement with the external world.
- Openness to Experience describes a dimension of cognitive style that distinguishes imaginative, creative people from down-to-earth, conventional people.
- Agreeableness reflects individual differences in concern with cooperation and social harmony. Agreeable individuals value getting along with others.
- Conscientiousness concerns the way in which we control, regulate, and direct our impulses.

> Fun fact: both OCEAN and CANOE are mnemonic devices that can help you recall the names of the Big Five dimensions.

Since the results of a Big Five test, such as the IPIP-NEO, are five numbers, you don't get assigned a personality "type" by these tests. Rather, you may be provided with an explanation of what it means to score high (or low) on, say, Extraversion. You may have noticed that extraversion (occasionally spelled "extroversion") appears on both the MBTI and the Big Five.

### Twenty Questions (about Extraversion) {-}

Suppose, for whatever reason, we want to identify a person's extraversion. We may want either (a) to classify them as extraverted or not (i.e., introverted), or (b) to quantify a degree of extraversion, say on a scale of 0-100. Why not then just pose the question in the following way. In the first case:

a) Choose the one that describes you: Extraverted \ \ \ \ | \ \ \ \ Introverted

or, in the second case, 

b) Identify yourself on the following scale: Extraversion  0 -- + -- + -- + -- + -- 50 -- + -- + -- + -- + -- 100    

Personality tests, such as those we've discussed above, do not ask questions like these. Rather, they include many different questions, sometimes twenty or even more, about things like going to parties, making friends, and drawing attention to oneself. 

Why ask twenty questions instead of just one? Recall from the great toilet paper debate that no one ever felt it was necessary to ask twenty questions to know whether you were an over-hanger or an under-hanger. However, when we discussed digitidiness, we suspected that two different questions may have both been getting at the same latent factor. The situation here, in the real-life domain of personality testing, is similar. 

Psychologists ~~believe that extraversion is an underlying factor~~ invented the idea of extraversion to explain patterns of behavior, including patterns of responses to questions about how people feel in various situations. Such as enjoyment or lack thereof in being the center of attention. The use of indirect evidence such as questionnaire responses to make inferences about psychological traits is the main task of **psychological measurement** or psychometrics. The main challenge of psychometrics, perhaps even the reason for its existence, is that human beings are noisy. 

Put another way, you cannot expect a deterministic relationships between how a person feels or acts in one situation and how they act in another. An extraverted person is not *always* extraverted. And an extraverted person might not always answer questions about their feelings in the same way. It is hard to observe or even self-report on extraversion directly, because extraversions manifests itself differently at different times and in different contexts. Whether this noise is due to some mysterious internal process, like a coin flip in your brain, or due to many unnaccountable external factors, like whether you slept poorly that day, we can't say. What we can say is that human noisiness manifests itself as **measurement error**.^[The word **error** makes it sounds like there is a right answer, and that tests get it wrong. This is, indeed, one view. However, you don't have to believe that there is a right answer. For example, you can believe that human beings have some amount of inherent unpredictability.] We can also say that, in spite of measurement error, some patterns do remain.


### But what's the point? {-}

Trying to describe people in terms of kinds or numerical scales is complicated. Why do we even bother? It's tempting to say that we just want to understand ourselves better, and that is certainly a  reasonable answer. Sometimes, though, we want to predict how someone will act in the future, perhaps in a situation that differs from one that they have faced in the past. In that case, we can't exactly use the past to predict the future, unless we do so by making inferences about underlying traits from past behaviors and then predicting how someone with those particular traits would act in a new context. This purpose drives some uses of tests based on the MBTI and the Big Five, for example by employers or career counselors. However, although the MBTI is oftern used for these purposes, one should exercise caution in doing so [@pittenger1993]. You should certainly not assume that all personality tests do an equally good job of providing information for the desired inferences.

According to the standards of the American Psychological Association [@american1999], whenever psychological tests are used for some specific purpose (e.g., employment, admission to a school or hospital, or even in court) there must be a valid argument for the intended purpose of the test scores. This **validation argument** will usually involve many facets, including how consistent the results of the test are, whether it is a fair test for all groups of people, whether test scores really are associated with relevant outcomes in the domain of use, and so on. These arguments, and challenges to them, are all part of validity.


## Still meta after all these pages {-}

I'd like to point out that we still haven't even once asked a question of the form "what proportion of people..." or "what is the probability that a person...?" There's nothing wrong with these questions, and we will have plenty of time to investigate questions of this kind in the remaining chapters about other Big Questions. But to be true to our question about how many kinds of people are there, we didn't need to know all of the specifics. Our discussion has been rather *metaphysical*, in the sense that we have tried to understand how differences that we observe among people can be expressed in terms of kinds (categories) or numbers, which are different *kinds* of data. Whoa.


## Exercise {-}

+ Come up with a population (the members do not have to be human beings) and three *creative* summary statistics that can be derived about it (i.e., go beyond average weight).
